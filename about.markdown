I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Amazon, Last Mile. I think the way we build things matters just as much as what we build - especially the environment we create around us. I enjoy bringing simplicity to complex problems, learning new things, and writing ideas down to see how clear my thinking actually is. 

In the real world, my wife and I live in Seattle with our rescue dog, Luna. I love to get out into the mountains as much as possible - climbing, hiking, running, whatever.
